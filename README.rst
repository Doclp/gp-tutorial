A Gaussian Process Tutorial
===========================

This repository is intended to serve as a tutorial on the use of
Gaussian process regression techniques, principly for surrogate
modelling in astrophysics, but will also touch on other topics, such
as latent variable GP priors as it develops.

Right now this repository is very much a draft, and it's likely to
change quite a lot as it develops.

Contents

1. Introduction
2. Covariance Functions
3. Gaussian Process Regression
4. Surrogate modelling with GPR
5. Latent Variable GP Priors
